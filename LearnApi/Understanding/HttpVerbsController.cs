            HTTP Methods
            - GET
            - POST
            - PUT
            - HEAD
            - DELETE
            - PATCH
            - OPTIONS
            
            GET
            GET requests are the most common and widely used methods in APIs and websites. Simply put, the GET method is used to retreive data from a server at the
            specified resource. For example, say you have an API with a /users endpoint. Making a GET request to that endpoint should return a list of all available
            users.
            
            Since a GET request is only requesting data and not modifying any resources, it's considered a safe and idempotent method.
            
            Testing an API with GET requests
            When you're creating tests for an API, the GET method will likely be the most frequent type of request made by consumers of the service, so it's important
            to check every known endpoint with a GET request.
            
            At a basic level, these things should be validated:
            - Check that a valid GET request returns a 200 status code.
            - Ensure that a GET request to a specific resource returns the correct data. For example, GET /users returns a list of users.
            
            GET is often the default method in HTTP clients, so creating tests for these resources should be simple with any tool you choose.
            
            
            POST
            In web services, POST requests are used to send data to the API server to create or update a resource. The data sent to the server is stored in the request
            body of the HTTP request.
            
            The simplest example is a contact form on a website. When you fill out the inputs in a form and hit Send, that data is put in the response body of the
            request and sent to the server. This may be JSON, XML or query parameters (there's plenty of other formats, but these are the most common).
            
            It's worth nothing that a post request is non-idempotent. It mutates data on the backend server (by creating or updating a resource), as opposed to a GET
            request which does not change any data.
            
            Testing an API with POST requests
            The second most common HTTP method you'll encounter in your API tests is POST. As mentioned above, POST requests are used to send data to the API server
            and create or update a resource. Since POST requests modify data, it's important to have API tests for all of your POST methods.
            
            Here are some tips for testing POST requests:
            - Create a resource with a POST request and ensure a 200 status is returned.
            - Next, make a GET request for that resource, and ensure the data was saved correctly.
            - Add tests that ensure POST requests fail with incorrect or ill-formatted data.
            
            
            PUT
            Similar to POST, PUT requests are used to send data to the API to update or create a resource. The difference is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is,
            calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly make have side effects of
            creating the same resource multiple times.
            
            Generally, when a PUT request creates a resource the server will respond with a 201 (created), and if the request modifies existing resource the server
            will return a 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content).
            
            Testing an API with PUT requests
            Testing an APIs PUT method is very similar to testing POST requests. But now that we know the difference between the two (idempotency), we can create API
            tests to confirm this behavior.
            
            Check for these things when testing PUT requests:
            - Repeatedly calling a PUT request always returns the same result.
            - The proper status code is returned when creating and updating a resource (eg 201 or 200/204).
            - After updating a resource with a PUT request, a GET request for that resource should return the correct data.
            - PUT requests should fail if invalid data is supplied in the request - nothing should be udpated.
            
            
            PATCH
            A PATCH request is one of the lesser-known HTTP methods, but I'm including it this high in the list since it is similar to POST and PUT. The difference
            with PATCH is that you only apply partial modifications to the resource.
            
            The difference between PATCH and PUT, is that a PATCH request is non-idempotent (like a POST request).
            
            To expand on partial modification, say you're API has a /users/{{userid}} endpoint, and a user has a username. With a PATCH request, you may only need to
            send the updated username in the request body - as opposed to POST and PUT which require the full user entity.
            
            Testing an API with PATCH requests
            Since the PATCH method is so similar to POST and PUT, many of the same testing techniques apply. It's still important to validate the behavior of any
            API endpoints that accept this method.
            
            What to look for when testing PATCH requests:
            - A successful PATCH request should return a 2xx status code.
            - PATCH requests should fail if invalid data is supplied in the request - nothing should be updated.
            
            The semantics of PATCH requests will largely depend on the specific API you're testing.
            
            
            DELETE
            The DELETE method is exactly as it sounds: delete the resource at the specified URL. This method is one of the more common in RESTful APIs so it's good to
            know how it works.
            
            If a new user is created with a POST request to /users, and it can be retrieved with a GET request to /users/{{userid}}, then making a DELETE request to
            /users/{{userid}} will completely remove that user.
            
            Testing an API with DELETE requests
            DELETE requests should be heavily tested since they generally remove data from a database. Be careful when testing DELETE methods, make sure you're using
            the correct credentials and not testing with real user data.
            
            A typical test case for a DELETE request would look like this:
            - Create a new user with a POST request to /users.
            - With the user id returned from the POST, make a DELETE request to /users/{{userid}}
            - A subsequent GET request to /users/{{userid}} should return a 404 not found status code.
            
            In addition, sending a DELETE request to an unknown resource should return a non-200 status code.
            
            
            HEAD
            The HEAD method is almost identical to GET, except without the response body. In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, the HEAD /users will
            make the same request but won't get back the list of users.
            
            HEAD requests are useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request - like before downloading a large file or response
            body.
            
            It's worth pointing out that not every endpoint that supports GET will support HEAD - it completely depends on the API you're testing.
            
            Testing an API with HEAD requests
            Making API requests with HEAD methods is actually an effective way of simply verifying that a resource is available. It is good practice to have a test
            for HEAD requests everywhere you have a test for GET requests (as long as the API supports it).
            
            Checking these things when testing an API with HEAD requests:
            - Verify and check HTTP headers returned from a HEAD request.
            - Make assertions against the status code of HEAD requests.
            - Test requests with various query paramaters to ensure the API responds.
            
            Another useful case for HEAD requests is API smoke testing - make a HEAD request against every API endpoint to ensure they're available.
            
            
            OPTIONS
            Last but not least, we have OPTIONS requests. OPTIONS requests are one of my favorites, though not as widely used as the other HTTP methods. In a nutshell,
            an OPTIONS request should return data describing what other methods and operations the server supports at the given URL.
            
            OPTIONS requests are more loosely defined and used than the others, making them a good candidate to test for fatal API errors. If an API isn't expecting
            an OPTIONS request, it's good to put a test case in place that verifies failing behavior.
            
            Testing an API with OPTIONS requests
            Testing an OPTIONS request is dependent on the web service; whether or not it supports that and what is supposed to return will define how you should test it.
            
            How to validate an endpoint using OPTIONS:
            - Primarily, check the response headers and status code of the request.
            - Test endpoints that don't support OPTIONS and ensure they fail appropriately.
